# Tyre-Energy-Dissipation-Model
## Overview

The Tyre Energy Dissipation Model is a detailed simulation tool designed to analyse how tyres dissipate energy during a race. By accounting for factors such as tyre compound, surface temperature, lateral and longitudinal forces, and degradation, this tool enables motorsport teams to optimise their strategies for tyre usage and performance.

## Features

- **Physics-Based Calculations**: Simulates tyre energy dissipation under lateral and longitudinal forces.
- **Customisable Inputs**: Configure parameters like track temperature, tyre compound, and vehicle dynamics.
- **Degradation Analysis**: Models how tyre wear impacts energy dissipation and grip levels.
- **Multi-Series Support**: Adaptable for various racing disciplines.
- **Visualisation Tools**: Generate graphs for energy dissipation, tyre temperature, and degradation.
